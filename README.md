## Background 📃

A team of enthusiastic data scientists identified a need to develop a personalized Note Taking Application called **Scribble**. To build this, they have to utilize Python, HTML and Flask framework to create the application server. While at the development stage, the team ran into some **challenges** with the backend which prevented it from being fully functional. Recognizing my proficiency in backend development, I have been tasked with fixing the broken code to ensure the application works seamlessly.

## How it is supposed to work

The Scribble application is such that the home route or page contains a text field and a button. And users can add a note, and all the notes will be displayed as an unordered list below the text field on the same page.
