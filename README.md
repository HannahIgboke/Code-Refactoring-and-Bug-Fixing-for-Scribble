## Background üìÉ

A team of enthusiastic data scientists identified a need to develop a personalized Note Taking Application called **Scribble**. To build this, they have to utilize Python, HTML and Flask framework to create the application server. While at the development stage, the team ran into some **challenges** with the backend which prevented it from being fully functional. Recognizing my proficiency in backend development, I have been tasked with fixing the broken code to ensure the application works seamlessly.

## How it is supposed to work

The Scribble application is such that the home route or page contains a text field and a button. And users can add a note, and all the notes will be displayed as an unordered list below the text field on the same page.


## Tech Stack usedüõ†

- Python
- Flask
- HTML

## Knowledge Check

The words 'GET' and 'POST' are used frequently in the course of this project. Here are what they mean:

GET - refers to requests used to retrieve data from a system. In this case, the GET request is expected to respond to the user who inputted the url by loading the note taking page

POST - refers to requests used to submit data to be processed, in this case - the notes/scribbles is the data, clicking in the add note button by the user initiates a POST request



## Issues/bugs üêõ identified

1. Route method mismatch
